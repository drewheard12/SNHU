# SNHU C++ and Python Inventory
Created while at SNHU

#This project takes a file containing the sales from a grocery store and outputs it into easily read formats using C++ integrated with Python. The program produces a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased, produces a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day, or produces a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased based on user input.
#I like the ways all the lists and dictionaries work together to transform the raw input into something more readable.
#Looking back, I could have compartmentalized the code into more specific functions. This could have made the program more effecient.
#The most challenging part of this code was getting the initial C++ and Python configured correctly within VS. I took lots of advice from stackoverflow.com to get around my issues.
#Every aspect of this project seemed important, but the file manipulation and the integration of languages seems to be the most important skills to carry on to other projects.
#Making the code readable and maintainable was done by including plenty of in line comments and following standard coding practices. In hindsight, the program could have been more adaptable with better input validation and exceptions.
